* Repo contents

- some scripts of mine, I hope you will find some of them useful.
- some scripts may come from elsewhere on the net, I wrote the credit
  when I remember the origin, if you see one w/o it, please open an
  issue

* Documentation

Dependances :

  - multi-tea.zsh -> ding-dong.zsh -> minuter.zsh -> bell.zsh -> audio files
    + audio files are not on this repo, just pick your fav and change
      them in the script
  - meditation.zsh -> random.zsh, mpv-socket.bash, audio files
  - I generate "speaking" audio files using pico2wave (svox-pico-git on AUR)
  - For audio samples, see also https://freesound.org

* Warning

I try to be mindful when I code, but some bugs might remain, so be careful.
