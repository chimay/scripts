# Random list with priorities for music & wallpaper

These tools can help you build shuffled list for your music collection,
but they can also be used to change your wallpaper dynamically.

[random.zsh](https://github.com/chimay/scripts/blob/master/zsh/random.zsh)
produces numbers which look remotely like a normal random distribution.
The goal here is not to be precise, but to roughly shuffle lists.
Itâ€™s written in pure zsh, no need for python or another external
random generator.

[gen-random-list.zsh](https://github.com/chimay/scripts/blob/master/zsh/gen-random-list.zsh)
produces shuffled list while taking file priorities into account. The
priority is specified using the format [0-9A-Z]-\* in the file name. It
uses basic unix tools.

Note : using file tags to handle priorities would be much slower.

[wallpaper.zsh](https://github.com/chimay/scripts/blob/master/zsh/wallpaper.zsh)
dynamically change your wallpaper using `feh` and the previous scripts.

See the `-h` option of these scripts for how to use them.

# Wallpaper

## Signals

You can send signals to the script, to :

- Generate a new file list (SIGUSR1)
- Go to the next file (SIGUSR2)
- Save status file and stop (HUP, INT, TERM)

As an example, some keybindings in my sxhkdrc :

```
# Generate a new list
hyper + w ; r
	pkill -10 -f wallpaper.zsh

# Set next file as wallpaper
hyper + w ; n
	pkill -12 -f wallpaper.zsh
```
